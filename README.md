# Classificatiion-of-Trash
One of the most important steps of waste management is separating the waste into different components; this
of the waste into different components and this process is normally done manually by handpicking. This segregation done by manual labour forces can bring health related issues to the waste 
sorters and also be less efficient, time-consuming, and not completely feasible due to their large 
amount. This paper proposes a solution that can identify and classify the waste and organize it into 
a particular waste bin (recyclable, organic, and harmful wastes) without any human hand. A 
computer-vision approach to classifying garbage into recycling categories could be an efficient 
way to process waste. The objective of this project is to take images of a single piece of 
recycling or garbage and classify it into six classes consisting of glass, paper, metal, plastic, 
cardboard, and trash. We also create a dataset that contains around 400-500 images for each class, 
which was hand collected. We then use an SVM and CNN to classify the image into six categories 
of garbage classes. By using computer vision, we can predict the category of garbage that an object 
belongs to based on just an image. This process will help the environment make more valuable 
and ecologically safe and help us make a
and ecologically safe and help us to make rich green ecosystem and a promising better future.
